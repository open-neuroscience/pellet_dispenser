# pellet_dispenser

a 3D printable pellet dispenser, with two variants, one for mice, and one for rats.
This is a derivative from https://github.com/jackpkenn/PelletDispenser. Changes here include:
- Porting design to open source software (from Solid works to FreeCad)
- making system modular, pieces now can be printed individually and assembled together with screws
- replacing stepper motor with servo motor which is simpler to control directly from a microcontroller, and more affordable.
